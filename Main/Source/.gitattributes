# Prettier on Linux uses LF line endings, Git for Windows defaults to converting them to CRLF. 
# This caused false "modified file" warnings when switching between OSes.
# This file ensures consistent LF line endings for all text files across Linux and Windows.
# It prevents Git from performing automatic line ending conversion

# DEFAULT: Treat everything as binary (no processing)
* -text

# EXCEPTIONS: These are text files and should use LF endings
